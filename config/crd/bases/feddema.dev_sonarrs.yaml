                                          A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                                          relates the key and values.

                          of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                          traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading

                          features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                          within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                          a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                          publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints for this
                          Service should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready.
                          The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to
                          propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.
                          The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                          Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                          Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                          through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                          topologically close (e.g., same zone).

                          type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                          options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                          "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                          to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                          specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                          EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                          allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                          than a virtual IP.
                          "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                          routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                          "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                          (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                          as the clusterIP.
                          "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                          Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.
